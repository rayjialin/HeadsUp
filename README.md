"HEADS UP" - Midterm Project (Lighthouse Labs iOS Development Bootcamp)

For this midterm project, we created an app called HeadsUp that allows a user to find and meet another close user on the map within a certain range. Once the users have been matched, they have the opportunity to meet at a mid-point or the closest restaurant between them. After the users have both accepted to meet, a random icebreaker topic will appear on their screen as they start walking towards the desired point on the map. The users profile image is a reference as they search for them in person. The start button will trigger the "Heads Up Timer" where they'll have an opportunity to ask the other user in person about the given topic, as well as get to know them.
